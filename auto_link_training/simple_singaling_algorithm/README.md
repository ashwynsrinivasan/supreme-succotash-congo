# mrm-crr-locking
MRM and CRR search, locking, and cycling algorithm.
Sharing the algorithm using python notebooks.

## Setup
### Install prerequisites

The notebook was developed using `python 3.11`.
To install all the required packages, do:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Notebooks available

Currently there are two notebooks available:
- `locking_expt_simple.ipynb`: MRM-CRR search, locking, and cycling using simple algorithm
- `locking_expt_signal.ipynb`: MRM-CRR search, locking, and cycling using signal-based algorithm

## Working notes

Working notes and results of the algorithms mentioned are in the [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DFWHvgMVz4edGZKCpO5udHemimYUdxbajkAdo7brLyE/edit?usp=sharing).
